```

#### Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file with the following:
```env
SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
SLACK_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Overview

### Frontend:
- Built using React + TailwindCSS.
- Authenticates via Slack OAuth.
- Allows message input, recipient selection, and time scheduling.

### Backend:
- Node.js + Express.js server.
- Handles Slack OAuth flow.
- Stores access tokens securely in memory or DB.
- Manages scheduled jobs using `node-cron` or `setTimeout`.
- Communicates with Slack API to send scheduled messages.

### Key Concepts:
- **OAuth**: Redirects to Slack for permission, gets authorization code, exchanges it for access token.
- **Token Management**: Stores tokens linked to Slack users for later API usage.
- **Scheduled Tasks**: On message schedule, backend saves and triggers message dispatch at specified time.

## üìå Features
- Slack OAuth integration
- Message scheduling UI
- Real-time list of scheduled and sent messages
- Backend scheduler for posting messages

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Learnings

### Challenges:
- **OAuth complexity**: Understanding the OAuth 2.0 flow and configuring proper redirect URIs took time.
- **Scheduling reliability**: Ensuring tasks persist and execute even if the server restarts was a concern.
- **Frontend-backend coordination**: Managing session state and OAuth flow across both parts.

### Learnings:
- Hands-on experience with OAuth 2.0 and API integrations.
- Scheduled task management in Node.js.
- Structuring a full-stack app using React and Express.
- Environment variable security and configuration.

## üöÄ Deployment

You can deploy the app using:

### GitHub Pages (Frontend only)
- Push your frontend code to a GitHub repo.
- Use `gh-pages` npm package or GitHub Actions to deploy.

### Vercel (Recommended)
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and connect your GitHub repo.
- Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard.
- It auto-deploys on push.

### Backend Deployment
- Host on Render, Railway, or any Node-friendly cloud platform.
